# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm

This is a command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, utilizing the powerful Minimax algorithm to provide a challenging opponent.

## How to Play

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

### Running the Game

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peter-N-Wainaina/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python tictactoe
   ```

Follow the prompts to play the game.

## About

I developed this project after learning Minimax in CS 4700, an intro AI class to explore the Minimax algorithm,and its application in creating an unbeatable AI opponent for Tic Tac Toe. The primary goal was to understand and implement an AI algorithm capable of making optimal decisions in a simple game scenario.

## Why Minimax?
The Minimax algorithm is a key concept in artificial intelligence, particularly in decision-making scenarios with two adversarial agents, where the goal is to minimize potential loss while maximizing potential gain. Its application in games, like Tic Tac Toe, showcases its ability to determine the best possible move at any given state of the game.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing a graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.
- Enhancing the AI's capabilities to support bigger boards.
- Adding more customization options for the players.
  
  - Allowing players to pass in board params via command line.
  - Allow 2 human players.
